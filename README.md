# Split Then Encrypt

This tool allows you to split a large file into smaller chunks and then encrypt each chunk individually. This can be useful for securely storing or transmitting large files.

- Split large files into smaller, manageable chunks
- Encrypt each chunk using a strong encryption algorithm
- Decrypt and reassemble the original file from the chunks

## Usage

1. Put your large ZIP file then rename it `input.zip`
2. Run the tool to split and encrypt the file
3. Store or transmit the encrypted chunks
4. To retrieve the original file, decrypt each chunk and reassemble
